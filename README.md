# wikiladders

The goal of this repository is to create AIs to play the Wikipedia Game, where a player tries to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another by clicking internal Wikipedia links. 
For instance, it is possible to get from the article "Kyoto" to the similarly pronounced "Coyote" article with only three clicks: "Kyoto Prefecture", "Oklahoma", "coyotes".

Currently, the repo only offers iterative deepening, a highly general search algorithm which does not leverage any learning techniques. An example is given in ```src/main/java/wikiladders/Driver.java```.
